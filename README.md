Computer Science student at SUTD with strong skills in software engineering, AI automation, and chatbot development. My flagship project is an ASP initiative where I developed a non-invasive blood glucose monitor for diabetic patients, leveraging machine learning to predict blood glucose levels from data collected by a wearable prototype. I am passionate about mastering technology to build impactful, cutting-edge software solutions.
